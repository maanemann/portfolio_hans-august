Complex worlds simplified into a single display. In the spirit of how the game itself unfolds, not everything is explained. You have to explore to make sense of it, and it becomes intuitive and logical.",

In collaboration with creative director Mikkel Thorsted I had lots of fun helping with ideate, designing and implementing the UI / UX. The challenge was to give the player the most intuitive possible approach to building a 3D vehicle on a flat screen – similar to building with Lego, but without the physical aspect. And with the addition of rocket engines. \n Apart from the building interface, I also worked on the inventory for the many blocks you find on your journey, which have to be sorted and stored in a way that makes all parts easily accessible.",

When the game was ported to iOS / iPadOS I helped with rethinking the UI to make it touch-friendly. As something new for the menu, I decided to approach the game world's triangular grid (or trixel grid) as a strict dogma. So I created everything in the UI out of triangles. This way the UI blends naturally into the game world, rather than being a layer on top of it.",
