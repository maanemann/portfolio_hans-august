    "description": "I had the honour of designing the interface for Cocoon, an award-winning puzzle game, in which you delve deep into surreal worlds, nested within each other. From Geometric Interactive, a talented team, including developers behind Limbo and Inside. \n Here you see the loading screen, round like a dial, or a clock. It gives an overview of the game, your progress and other information that you learn to understand through playing the game. Everything you see is bound to the symbolics and logics of the game, all boiled down to one display."

    "description": "Trailmakers gives you an open world to explore with the help of any thinkable vehicle that you build yourself. In collaboration with creative director Mikkel Thorsted I had a lot of fun brainstormin, designing and implementing the UI / UX for the player to get the most intuitive approach to building a 3D vehicle on a flat screen – sorta like Lego, but without being able to touch the pieces, and with rocket engines. \n Apart from the building interface, I also worked on the inventory for the many blocks you find on your journey, which have to be sorted and stored in a way that makes sense to the player."

    "description": "Kalimba is a puzzle platformer, in which everything is build of triangles. When the game was ported to iOS it required a new, touch-friendly UI, which was my responsibility. As something new for the menu, I decided to approach the in-game triangle (or trixel) grid as a strict dogma and made everything in the UI out of triangles. This way the UI blends naturally into the game world, instead of just being a layer on top of it."

    "description": "This is the result of an unreleased project made with Mikkel Kortsen Sørensen. After interviewing a number of subjects on their use of digital health services, we found that many people were misinformed and scared by the information they found online. We wanted to create a service that would provide validated information in a calm and reassuring way. \n \"Ro/På\" (loosely translated to \"don't worry\") is a suggestion for how the The Danish Health Authority could provide us with validated information, served in proportion to how common or rare the illness is, and with thorough guidance for how to treat it."
